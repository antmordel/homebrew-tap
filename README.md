# Nito Tap

This repo exists because the formulas that this tap provides are not fully compliant with Homebrew. Otherwise I'd could
make PRs to Homebrew.

This is the case of Maude, which compilation process is not 100% straightforward.

## Current formulas in this repository

- [maude](./Formula/maude.rb)

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install antmordel/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap antmordel/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.
